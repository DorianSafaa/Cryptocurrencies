# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the analysis
 
For this project, we aim to learn about cryptocurrencies and how they can be grouped into a classification system for new investments. This is an unsupervised learning problem since we don't know what the output will be. Clustering was chosen as the way to categorize the cryptocurrencies. Afterwards, we incorporated data visualization to present our findings.
